## Summary 
The Analysis shows the different usage patterns for bike-sharing in NYC. This data gives a good picture of bikes being used for short trips to commute in urban areas by men for the majority of bikes used. This anaylsis can be furthered usng the avalible data however, by firstly creating a symbole map containing the data of where trips take place and how long the average trips from those locations are in order to see if location can have an effect on both number of rides but as well how it connects to average ride length. Finally another way to look into the data would be considering a heat map which breaks down usage hours by age in order to see if there is variation in usage patterns by age, suc as if retirred folks have higher usage hours during the middle of the day in compirsion to higher usage hours for working age folks during commuting hours.
